                        Organic Agriculture can be summarized
                        simply as ‘Systems of agriculture that produces food and fiber free from industrially produced
                        chemicals.’ It encompasses minerals, salts from natural sources, but the basic clear requirement
                        is freedom from industrial chemicals such as fertilizer salts, herbicides and pesticides . There
                        are many variations of agricultural practice worldwide which operate on this basis. Examples
                        being, Biodynamic, Certified Organic, Natural Farming etc.
                        The distinction between organic and not organic, has its roots in the current dilemma facing
                        food production through agriculture. Should we demand maximum production from land or optimum
                        long-term management of resources? If maximum, levels of production is required, the system has
                        to be boosted with external input until the natural system is replaced with a new energy
                        dependent system, but these levels of production cannot be maintained without a constant input
                        of external energy. Thus, organic agriculture, rejecting industrially produced chemicals are
                        constrained to the natural levels of productivity that can be optimized, without requiring a
                        constant input of external energy. It is this component of external energy used to increase
                        productivity of crops that needs careful examination. The external energy component of
                        agricultural systems that relies on industrial chemicals is usually very consequent and based on
                        fossil fuels.

                        In addition, it is fossil energy that drives the tractor and creates fertilizers, pesticides and
                        weedicides. The burning of fossil fuels to power such a production system adds greatly to
                        climate change and impacts future productivity through Global Warming. Does this mean that
                        organic farming should all be done without machinery? These concerns should also be addressed,
                        as the current ‘agricultural development’ processes has been seen to increase the fossil energy
                        percentage of all industrially produced food, adding to the climate change burden of each
                        country
                        Thus, the idea that Organic Agriculture can be defined as ‘Systems of agriculture that produces
                        food and fiber free from industrial or fossil derived chemicals’, has true value higher than
                        those of quality and sustainability. It identifies an adherence and response to the global
                        demand to reduce substantially the fossil carbon footprint in food production. To understand how
                        industrial farming affects the Earth and why it affects sustainability.
                        In any debate on agriculture the complexity and value of a living agricultural soil needs to be
                        understood. To many of us soil is the stuff that holds trees up. We see it as a solid surface
                        for us to walk, ride or construct upon. Its usefulness in our daily lives, extends far beyond
                        providing a substrate and nutrient for our crops; on closer examination this 'solid mass' of
                        soil is home to thousands of species , it acts a sea to billions of organisms that live in it.
                        Soil is also the biological filter that detoxifies a large proportion of the poisons that we
                        throw into the environment we live in. It is an underground living world as complex as, and most
                        certainly older than, the world that lives on its surface. It covers most of the land surface of
                        the planet, it is in a very real sense the 'living skin' of our planet.

                        The world of soil is bizarre to those of us who live on the surface. It is opaque to light and
                        mostly
                        solid and impenetrable. Communication is by chemicals, e.g.. pheromones or physical, e.g..
                        vibrations.
                        Movement is slow, the faster organisms like the worms are the giants of this world, tunnelling
                        through
                        at a fairly rapid rate measured in centimeters per minute. More common are the fungi who move by
                        growing
                        through the soil at rates measured in centimeters per month, or the bacteria which have rates
                        measured
                        in centimeters per year.
                        It is a busy world, one gram of ordinary farmyard soil can contain over 1 billion individual
                        bacteria,
                        over 100 million individual actinomyctes and over 1 kilometer of fungal hyphpae, notwithstanding
                        plants
                        like algae and animals like collembolids, nematodes or worms. The estimates of the mass of
                        living
                        organisms in a fertile living soil is estimated at about 10,000 to 14,000 Kg per hectare. This
                        is the
                        key for agriculture that support mankind for millennia. A good soil with a mass of living
                        microorganisms
                        amounting to over 8000 tons per hectare, represents an energetic input equivalent to about that
                        supplied
                        by twenty horses or twenty horsepower of energy, applied 24 hours a day. It is this energy spent
                        on
                        natural soil chemical transformations that supply the energy to maintain a healthy soil
                        ecosystem. In
                        traditional farming systems, the addition of compost, green manure, cultured microorganisms
                        etc., was
                        used to enhance the natural fertility of a field. Some such approaches have produced noteworthy
                        results,
                        but none could produce the crop levels achieved through the artificial input of industrial
                        chemicals.
                        However, this increase has a tremendous cost, that will ultimately impact the sustainability of
                        food
                        production and human well-being.

                The hidden costs of industrial chemicals being applied to the ecosystem, irrespective of its cost to
                climate stability, is its cost in soil biomass and biodiversity loss. There is an ecological axiom that
                states ‘energy flow through an ecosystem, tends to organize and simplify it’. When high energy
                industrial chemicals are applied onto the soil, many species of biota are lost and its biomass gradually
                decreases. The huge mass and diversity of soil microorganisms is gradually reduced until finally, the
                natural productivity of the soil is lost through attrition and it cannot produce without a further input
                of industrial chemicals. The living soil has been lost and the farm has become addicted to the
                additional energy of industrial chemical in order to produce a crop.
                Industrial chemicals are produced with their huge carbon footprint being absorbed by the subsidies
                extended to fossil energy products by global governments. The cost to the global commons is internalized
                by each nation and untaxed. The impact of this subsidy is being felt today at the farm level and has set
                up the challenge between organic (non-fossil dependent) and industrial (fossil dependent) agriculture.
                By clarifying the meaning of organic agriculture we will facilitate the distinction and appreciation of
                differences that exist between the two systems. The easy part is to identify the practice of Organic
                Agriculture as ‘Systems of agriculture that produces food and fiber, free of industrial chemicals.’ The
                more difficult task is to standardize the plethora of bureaucratic demands surrounding organic
                certification, to farmers that ‘prove’ their authenticity in order to access the ‘Organic ‘market. In
                agriculture, It has been clearly demonstrated that ‘sustainability’ and mitigating Climate Change
                impacts, depend completely on reducing their fossil Carbon footprint. Thus, Organic agriculture has a
                huge role to play in adapting to the oncoming changes in the global climate, while industrial
                agriculture must bear its global responsibilities and pay the costs of production that are currently
                internalized due to subsidies extended to it. The signs emerging from a warming planet suggest that, a
                return to hyperlocal forms of economy, will be essential for adapting to climate change, here, Organic
                Agriculture can play a pivotal role.
