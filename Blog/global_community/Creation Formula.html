                    rom the Archean, 3.5 billion years
                    ago, until the present there is a consistent pattern in all
                    of evolutionary history, increases in biomass and biodiversity the operations of which,
                    create
                    ecosystems services. Although, biomass was impacted five times in the history of life, such
                    that
                    a large percentage of the existing biomass was fossilised, the imperative at each response
                    was
                    the growth of biomass. The time that biomass could remain resident in any area for periods
                    of
                    time produced biodiversity, in other words, biodiversity are the patterns wrought in biomass
                    over time and space. Because we are all a part of it, we see ourselves when we see the
                    spirit of
                    life.
                    We are children of light. Light from the sun, streaming out into the universe, is slowed
                    down
                    briefly, to power the manifestation of life on this planet, before it is released to
                    continue
                    its journey outwards. This act is created by photosynthetic biomass (PB), the green matter
                    of
                    all plants, where the molecule chlorophyll performs the act of primary production, the
                    initial
                    step in the manifestation of life. This is the process of carbon dioxide and water being
                    fused
                    together to hold the energy of sunlight while releasing oxygen. The ability to increase
                    living
                    biomass through the absorption of solar radiation while releasing oxygen and water vapour
                    into
                    the atmosphere, is the first act of building life and is represented by the chemical
                    formula:
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center p-2">a6CO2 + a6H2O + e -> bC6H12O6 + b6O2</h3>
                <p>
                    It states that six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water from the atmospheric
                    cycle are joined by using the energy of sunlight to yield a biologically based sugar and six
                    molecules of biologically produced oxygen.
                    Chemically stated, this ‘Creation Formula’ represents the first act of life, the consequence of
                    this act is an environment rich in breathable oxygen and drinkable water to sustain its
                    manifestations. The actions or services created by invoking the formula, are termed ‘Primary
                    Ecosystem Services’; sugar production, oxygen generation and water transformation, i.e., all
                    actions essential for the sustainability of the life support system of the planet.
                    These ‘Primary Ecosystem Services’ are created by the action of photosynthesis which helped
                    create the oxygen rich atmosphere that we enjoy today. By the operation of the Creation Formula,
                    the annual output of carbon dioxide from volcanic activity was deposited as fixed carbon locked
                    for millions of years in the lithosphere as fossils. The oxygen generated by the activity was
                    retained in the atmosphere. The fossilised material was transformed into hydrocarbons within the
                    rock.
                    Hydrocarbons, made from the fossilisation of organic compounds of once living forms. It is the
                    burning of these fossil components using biologically generated oxygen that is currently driving
                    climate change and pushing the threat to life ever closer. The reason why becomes clear when the
                    generalised formula for hydrocarbon combustion is looked at, in terms of its combustion
                    products, which is responsible for climate change. Because of the effect it has on life It has
                    been chemically stated as the ‘Satanic Formula’
                </p>

                <P>Which sates that, burning fossil Hydrogen and fossil Carbon (Oil, Gas, Coal) using biologically
                    created
                    Oxygen, creates ‘new’ Carbon Dioxide and ‘new’ water vapour that never existed in the atmosphere
                    before.
                    These ‘new’ gaseous inputs into the atmosphere accelerate the current trends of rampant global
                    warming
                    and climate change. But there is another feature about this formula that really makes it
                    sinister and
                    that is the fact the global Oxygen concentration is falling , the natural world is unable to
                    cope with
                    the extraction. For instance, the total worldwide oil consumption was about 93 million barrels
                    per day
                    (bbl./day), to yield energy, the Oxygen out put of approximately 221,965,166 trees working for
                    one year
                    will be required and still, no replacement mechanism is being considered.
                    The need to address the problem becomes more urgent when the massive burning of Oxygen by the
                    defence
                    industry and the aerospace industry is considered. None of these industries acknowledge any
                    responsibility for burning up the global stocks, in fact developers like Elon Musk has openly
                    stated
                    that his operations are profitable because ‘Oxygen is free’. It is this ‘free rider’ that allows
                    the
                    externalising of costs involved in the use of the Global Commons. A ‘free rider’ that has led to
                    an
                    acceleration of the destruction of the stock of Oxygen in the Global Commons. Paying for its
                    replacement
                    is logical, practical and responsible The consequence of invoking ‘the Satanic Formula’ is
                    clear, in our wholehearted acceptance in invoking
                    the Satanic Formula as the basis of human development, we ignore the fact that by driving a
                    motor car or
                    taking an airplane or doing the myriad of things that shape our life’s activity, we invoke it
                    constantly
                    and contribute to the stifling of life!</P>

                <p> Can we change the current suicidal direction of human growth in terms of the economically defined
                    negative or positive externalities, the cost of negative externalities of all industrial processes needs
                    to be paid by the public, is there processes that provides positive externalities that provide benefit
                    and well-being to the public for no cost?
                    The basic problem is the ease with which operators can externalise their impact into the Global Commons
                    and not be held responsible for such action. In fact, much of the current value realised by the existing
                    economic system, is achieved by externalising (i.e., not paying for) the negative impact on the Global
                    Commons or the public.
                    The impact of such negative externalities allowed under the current economy is that ‘the degradation of
                    the Global Commons’ and consequently to the degradation of human well-being as seen by the crises
                    brought about by climate change and the exponential increase of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
                    Invoking the ‘Satanic Formula’ has brought us nothing but destruction and suffering, perhaps it is time
                    to reject the economy of death and look to building a new economy by invoking the ‘Creation Formula’ and
                    creating an economy of life. TAn economic system, which values productivity without reliance on fossil
                    energy and renewable energy with
                    decentralised production becomes a development goal. A system where the value of Ecosystem Services can
                    be
                    realised.</p>

                    to
                    life and sustenance.
                    We have experienced the first avenue and indeed it leads to a bleak future, is it not time to stop
                    beating
                    ourselves with a hammer on the head to cure our headache and look for a jar of healing salve instead?</p>
