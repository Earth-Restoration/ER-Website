                        force when your life is threatened. Collectively, we enforce laws that protect the lives of all
                        members of a community, individually we act with defensive force to protect ones own life. But
                        what happens when life itself is threatened? All of a sudden both the individual and society
                        become disinterested observers. A lot of information is generated on how to perceive and
                        understand the problem. Things like Sustainability, Biodiversity and Conservation have become
                        the discussion topics around the signs that signal the threat to life, but there is no effort at
                        maintaining the activity and sustainability of life, in fact much of modern human endeavor seems
                        to be directed at extinguishing it!

                        Today we rapidly remove the conditions necessary for the continued existence of genetic,
                        ecological and cultural information, as these are seen to be unimportant to the society of
                        modern man. These losses have now reached critical proportions, the actions leading to such
                        losses being vindicated by the human value system called “Consumerist, growth oriented society”.
                        Using a theory called “Consumer sovereignty” where “whatever contributes to the satisfaction of
                        the individual is decreed good and whatever detracts from the individual satisfaction is decreed
                        bad”;

                        the salesmen of the world set about the activity of creating desire. So that, more and
                        more resources were required to satisfy the individual preference, The individual preference
                        being constantly redefined by the pecuniary actions of these same salesmen.
                        The product of such actions has been to place an ever-increasing demand on all resources, be it
                        renewable or non-renewable. As the values and ideals of the “Consumerist, growth oriented
                        society extend to include more and more of humanity, there is a proportionate reduction in the
                        ability of life to express itself on this planet.

                        Can we, modern humanity, be really accused of stifling the force of life? The answer is yes and
                        lies in our wholehearted accepatance of the Satanic Formula as the basis of human development
                        without understanding or appreciating what this acceptance means. The Satanic formula is derived
                        from the generalized formula for extracting energy from fossil fuel, which reads.
                        <span style="font-weight:bolder ;">CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O + e</span> This states that burning
                        Hydrocarbons (fossil Fuels) using Oxygen gives us Carbon Dioxide, water and energy. It is this
                        process that the entire industrial revolution was based upon it is this process that propels all
                        the transport and industry of the ‘modern’ era. Hydrocarbons are made from the fossilization of
                        organic compounds that once existed in the biosphere, it is made from living organisms that died
                        and was buried underground where they are compressed into the rocks and reside for time periods
                        measured in millions of years. This ‘fossil material has no contact with the living world.

                        Over geologic time vast quantities of carbon sequestered by living forms became fossilized in
                        this
                        manner and removed from the living world. With the fossil carbon there also resides fossil
                        hydrogen. And
                        it is the burning of these fossil components using biologically generated oxygen that is
                        currently
                        pushing the threat to life ever closer. The reason why becomes clear when the generalized
                        formula for
                        Hydrocarbon combustion is looked at, in terms of its combustion products, armed with this
                        knowledge, the
                        threat to life becomes clearer. Thus the Satanic Formula is stated as :

                        <span style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold;">fCH4 + bO2 -> nCO2 + nH2O + e</span>

                        Simply, it sates that burning fossil Hydrogen and fossil Carbon (Oil, Gas, Coal) using
                        biologically created
                        Oxygen, creates ‘new’ Carbon Dioxide and ‘new’ water vapor that never existed in the atmosphere
                        before.
                        These ‘new’ gaseous inputs into the atmosphere accelerate the current trends of rampant global
                        warming and
                        climate change. But there is another feature about this formula that really makes it sinister
                        and that is
                        the fact the global Oxygen concentration is falling and the only thing that keeps the global
                        concentration
                        levels up is photosynthesis by leaves and plankton.

                        The expansion of fossil based industry and farming at the expense of the forests and seas, not
                        only
                        destabilizes the atmosphere and accelerates global warming but it also removes the very basis
                        for the
                        expression of life by burning the biologically created Oxygen without paying for its
                        replacement.

                Normally, the Oxygen volume is about 21.9% globally, this level of concentration is critical to all of
                humanity and negative health effects begin to be felt if it drops below 19% when thinking and attention
                becomes impaired, as the levels drop to around 16 % there is reduced coordination, decreased ability for
                strenuous work, at 14% Poor judgment, faulty coordination, abnormal fatigue upon exertion, emotional
                upset
                cardiac stress. 10-12% Very poor judgment and coordination, impaired respiration heart damage, nausea,
                fainting, death.
                The current global concentration is about 21.9%, however this figure often dips to 19% over impacted
                areas and is down to 12%-17%. In cities with many trees such as in Alabama U.S.A it is 21.9% -19%. In
                cities with very low greenery and heavy urbanization such as Mexico City, it is 17% - 14%. As many will
                point out there is still a huge stock of Oxygen in the atmosphere. But the trends are disturbing. There
                has been a discernable drop in the Oxygen concentration following the Industrial revolution, this trend
                accelerating as the internal combustion engine competes with our lungs to access the global Oxygen
                stock.

                In a prophetic statement on the workings of the Satanic Formula, the 19th century English poet William
                Blake witnessed the emergence of what he termed “the dark Satanic Mills” of the industrial revolution
                where ‘”all the Arts of Life they changed into the Arts of Death”. This view is also echoed by the
                Indigenous tribe the Shwar who live in Amazonia and under whose feet lay oil deposits, which they refuse
                the extraction of, because they say “Oil represents the spirits of the dead to ask it for power, you
                sacrifice your children.” The reality of that saying is clear today with Global Warming and Oxygen loss.
                Could it be that the great industries and nations profiting from Oil, Coal and Gas at the expense of the
                sustainability of life, are the agents of Satan, of Iblis ? Could it be that those profiting from the
                burning of fossil fuels have a pact with the devil to destroy the expression of life? As a metaphor, the
                Satanic Formula is extremely distressing, but is it a metaphor? or more frighteningly, is it a statement
                of fact ?
