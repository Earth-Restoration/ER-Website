                    I walk the hills rising from an azure
                    blue Caribbean sea, and try to envision the history that I have been told, a history of an
                    island, green, tropical, rich in resources that fell into a despotic military aided rule. The
                    consequence of a power drunk ruler who made it easy for his cronies to move money across its
                    borders and legalized gambling to facilitate the Mafia to launder its ill-gotten money from the
                    US. The underworld became the lords and the land went out of reach for ordinary citizens. This
                    history spoke of a small group of dedicated people, who struggled through incredible odds and
                    fuelled by a shining love for their country, won the nation back from the underworld.
                    It was an impossibly small boat that arrived on the shores of Cuba with its cargo of committed
                    revolutionaries in 1956 ‘more dead than alive’ as Che recounted, loosing over half of their
                    comrades, in battles, yet they went on to win their nation back from the underworld. By this
                    action the amazing ability of the human spirit to rise to the ‘love of country’ is clearly
                    demonstrated. Cuba was embroiled in corruption, its dictator Batista was supported by gangsters,
                    thugs and killers. The huge inflow of money through their money laundering operations created a
                    massive disparity of income and Cuban society descended into a situation of economic
                    colonization. The corruption was so bad that the US president John F. Kennedy once stated:

                        and all the countries under
                        colonial domination, where economic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were worse
                        than
                        in Cuba, in part owing to my country’s policies during the Batista regime. I approved the
                        proclamation, which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, when he justifiably called for
                        justice and especially yearned to rid Cuba of corruption. I will even go further: to some
                        extent
                        it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the United
                        States. Now we shall have to pay for those sins. In the matter of the Batista regime, I am
                        in
                        agreement with the first Cuban revolutionaries. That is perfectly clear."</span> <br>
                    The history of Cuba haunted me on my return to Sri Lanka; one of the first actions of Batista on
                    gaining power was to facilitate the flow of external money through its economy and to legalize
                    gambling, which eased the entry of the mafia into the country to launder its ill-gotten wealth
                    from the US. One of the first actions of a past government of Sri Lanka was to liberalize the
                    flow of money through our nation and legalize gambling. Was this to be the creation of our own
                    Batistas and the surrendering of our nation to the underworld elements, local and of Asia,
                    Russia etc? As pointed out in the parliamentary speech by the late Mr. Mangala Samaraweera M.P
                    It is the activity of the underworld and their laundering of money though our economy that now
                    contributes to 'economic growth' <a

                    Such ‘misdirected growth’ is often promoted to enrich the people with power to amass capital but
                    it
                    creates a class of ‘super rich’ which rapidly widens the inequality gap between rich and poor.
                    The
                    reason as to why we should all be vigilant about the phenomenon of a widening inequality gap
                    between the
                    rich and the poor is very lucidly explained in the informative and eye opening book ‘The Spirit
                    Level’
                    <a href="www.amazon.com/The-Spirit-Level-Equality-Societies">
                        (www.amazon.com/The-Spirit-Level-Equality-Societies)</a> by two Epidemiologists, Richard
                    Wilkinson
                    and Kate
                    Pickett. Their data shows that the consequence of a widening ‘inequality gap’ degrades the
                    health and
                    well being of the people, this phenomenon applies to all countries from the so-called ‘rich’ to
                    the
                    so-called ‘poor’.
                    So, by all measures, from profiting in pandemic control, to officially sanctioned thuggery, it
                    seems
                    that we are descending again into a mafia controlled sate, rife with corruption, nepotism and
                    cronyism.
                    This process, like a cancer will eat into our society, destroy our culture and enslave our
                    children.
                    Time will come when decent people will yearn for justice and especially to rid the nation of
                    corruption.
                    But where will we find our champions? For us, this struggle will be hard. It has been commented
                    that this nation twice removed from its
                    genepool, the genes for activism and bravery. In 1971 the government ‘removed ‘up to 20,000 or
                    more of
                    the educated, poor. Those who attended university or demonstrated interest in radical politics
                    were
                    young or unemployed were singled out for liquidation. The next pogrom was in the late 1980’s
                    when over
                    60,000 were ‘removed’ without a word being uttered in protest on any international stage.

                These people
                never passed their genes on. Genetically speaking, we removed from our race a large percentage of the
                traits for high intellectual potential and activism.
                Metaphorically, It has become the time of the
                bottom feeders in our gene pool to manifest themselves as the intellectuals and leaders.
                Bottom feeders or ‘lowlife’ have a peculiar trait of myopia or short sightedness, that does not allow
                them to consider anything other than objects of their greed. Consider the recent reports from The IPCC
                that warns of the global temperature rise by 1.2 -2 degrees due to the burning of fossil fuel and the
                use of cement. Such a jump in global temperatures will exacerbate global poverty, trigger severe heat
                waves, sudden floods and droughts, and cause sea levels to rise by three feet, it will ravage food
                supplies. Called ‘A Code Red for Humanity ‘, these reports warn us of the immediate need to reduce
                emitting fossil carbon and to prepare for the oncoming crises. Given such a global scenario a
                responsible action would be to try and reduce our carbon footprint, but Sri Lanka’s ‘economic
                development’ gurus propose the exact opposite. Once, we were made to accept the burning of fossil fuel,
                the construction of mega projects with a huge carbon debt in cement and increased fossil fuel use, as
                ‘peoples development’. Which people? We may well ask. Looks like the peoples people are back, to carry
                on the promotion of irresponsible carbon emitting projects, as development processes. In the face of a
                population struggling with the rise of living, a pandemic and climate change, brought about by those
                very so-called ‘development’ actions, the madness just goes on. It is patently clear in current
                ‘development’ projects, most are grotesque to say the least.

                We crow that we have now entered a time of peace. But our rights are suppressed by the government using
                emergency laws. In war combatants die, but what about the horrendous loss of lives of innocents ? Do the
                innocents not deserve any consideration ? To a nation that values the act of giving merit to the
                departed, no action to remember or give merit to the dead is encouraged, in fact such activities are
                violently discouraged. We have become the ghouls that we accuse everyone else of being. All of the
                killers, torturers and those who reveled in that horror past, still stalk the corridors of power. No
                amount of propaganda can ever wash this blood from our hands. Only an honest and truthful reconciliation
                process with full accountability can!
