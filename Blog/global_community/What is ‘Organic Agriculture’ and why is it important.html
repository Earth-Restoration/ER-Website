                    rganic Agriculture can be summarized
                    simply as ‘Systems of agriculture that produces food and fiber free from industrially produced
                    chemicals.’ It encompasses minerals, salts from natural sources, but the basic clear requirement
                    is freedom from industrial chemicals such as fertilizer salts, herbicides and pesticides . There
                    are many variations of agricultural practice worldwide which operate on this basis. Examples
                    being, Biodynamic, Certified Organic, Natural Farming etc.
                    The distinction between organic and not organic, has its roots in the current dilemma facing
                    food production through agriculture. Should we demand maximum production from land or optimum
                    long-term management of resources? If maximum, levels of production is required, the system has
                    to be boosted with external input until the natural system is replaced with a new energy
                    dependent system, but these levels of production cannot be maintained without a constant input
                    of external energy. Thus, organic agriculture, rejecting industrially produced chemicals are
                    constrained to the natural levels of productivity that can be optimized, without requiring a
                    constant input of external energy. It is this component of external energy used to increase
                    productivity of crops that needs careful examination. The external energy component of
                    agricultural systems that relies on industrial chemicals is usually very consequent and based on
                    fossil fuels.
                </p>
                <P>In addition, it is fossil energy that drives the tractor and creates fertilizers, pesticides and
                    weedicides. The burning of fossil fuels to power such a production system adds greatly to
                    climate change and impacts future productivity through Global Warming. Does this mean that
                    organic farming should all be done without machinery? These concerns should also be addressed,
                    as the current ‘agricultural development’ processes has been seen to increase the fossil energy
                    percentage of all industrially produced food, adding to the climate change burden of each
                    country
                    Thus, the idea that Organic Agriculture can be defined as ‘Systems of agriculture that produces
                    food and fiber free from industrial or fossil derived chemicals’, has true value higher than
                    those of quality and sustainability. It identifies an adherence and response to the global
                    demand to reduce substantially the fossil carbon footprint in food production. To understand how
                    industrial farming affects the Earth and why it affects sustainability.
                    In any debate on agriculture the complexity and value of a living agricultural soil needs to be
                    understood. To many of us soil is the stuff that holds trees up. We see it as a solid surface
                    for us to walk, ride or construct upon. Its usefulness in our daily lives, extends far beyond
                    providing a substrate and nutrient for our crops; on closer examination this 'solid mass' of
                    soil is home to thousands of species , it acts a sea to billions of organisms that live in it.
                    Soil is also the biological filter that detoxifies a large proportion of the poisons that we
                    throw into the environment we live in. It is an underground living world as complex as, and most
                    certainly older than, the world that lives on its surface. It covers most of the land surface of
                    the planet, it is in a very real sense the 'living skin' of our planet.</P>

                <P>The world of soil is bizarre to those of us who live on the surface. It is opaque to light and
                    mostly
                    solid and impenetrable. Communication is by chemicals, e.g.. pheromones or physical, e.g..
                    vibrations.
                    Movement is slow, the faster organisms like the worms are the giants of this world, tunnelling
                    through
                    at a fairly rapid rate measured in centimeters per minute. More common are the fungi who move by
                    growing
                    through the soil at rates measured in centimeters per month, or the bacteria which have rates
                    measured
                    in centimeters per year.
                    It is a busy world, one gram of ordinary farmyard soil can contain over 1 billion individual
                    bacteria,
                    over 100 million individual actinomyctes and over 1 kilometer of fungal hyphpae, notwithstanding
                    plants
                    like algae and animals like collembolids, nematodes or worms. The estimates of the mass of
                    living
                    organisms in a fertile living soil is estimated at about 10,000 to 14,000 Kg per hectare. This
                    is the
                    key for agriculture that support mankind for millennia. A good soil with a mass of living
                    microorganisms
                    amounting to over 8000 tons per hectare, represents an energetic input equivalent to about that
                    supplied
                    by twenty horses or twenty horsepower of energy, applied 24 hours a day. It is this energy spent
                    on
                    natural soil chemical transformations that supply the energy to maintain a healthy soil
                    ecosystem. In
                    traditional farming systems, the addition of compost, green manure, cultured microorganisms
                    etc., was
                    used to enhance the natural fertility of a field. Some such approaches have produced noteworthy
                    results,
                    but none could produce the crop levels achieved through the artificial input of industrial
                    chemicals.
                    However, this increase has a tremendous cost, that will ultimately impact the sustainability of
                    food
                    production and human well-being.</P>

                <P>The hidden costs of industrial chemicals being applied to the ecosystem, irrespective of its cost to
                    climate stability, is its cost in soil biomass and biodiversity loss. There is an ecological axiom that
                    states ‘energy flow through an ecosystem, tends to organize and simplify it’. When high energy
                    industrial chemicals are applied onto the soil, many species of biota are lost and its biomass gradually
                    decreases. The huge mass and diversity of soil microorganisms is gradually reduced until finally, the
                    natural productivity of the soil is lost through attrition and it cannot produce without a further input
                    of industrial chemicals. The living soil has been lost and the farm has become addicted to the
                    additional energy of industrial chemical in order to produce a crop.
                    Industrial chemicals are produced with their huge carbon footprint being absorbed by the subsidies
                    extended to fossil energy products by global governments. The cost to the global commons is internalized
                    by each nation and untaxed. The impact of this subsidy is being felt today at the farm level and has set
                    up the challenge between organic (non-fossil dependent) and industrial (fossil dependent) agriculture.
                    By clarifying the meaning of organic agriculture we will facilitate the distinction and appreciation of
                    differences that exist between the two systems. The easy part is to identify the practice of Organic
                    Agriculture as ‘Systems of agriculture that produces food and fiber, free of industrial chemicals.’ The
                    more difficult task is to standardize the plethora of bureaucratic demands surrounding organic
                    certification, to farmers that ‘prove’ their authenticity in order to access the ‘Organic ‘market. In
                    agriculture, It has been clearly demonstrated that ‘sustainability’ and mitigating Climate Change
                    impacts, depend completely on reducing their fossil Carbon footprint. Thus, Organic agriculture has a
                    huge role to play in adapting to the oncoming changes in the global climate, while industrial
                    agriculture must bear its global responsibilities and pay the costs of production that are currently
                    internalized due to subsidies extended to it. The signs emerging from a warming planet suggest that, a
                    return to hyperlocal forms of economy, will be essential for adapting to climate change, here, Organic
                    Agriculture can play a pivotal role.</P>

                            I walk the hills rising from an azure blue Caribbean sea, and try to envision the history
                            that I have
                            been told, a history of an island, green, tropical, rich in resources rich in resources that
                            fell into a despotic military aided rule.
