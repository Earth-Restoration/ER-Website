                    The Global Commons sustain the air we
                    breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. It is under threat today, because the
                    Governments and financial institutions of every nation has accepted internalization of the use
                    of the resources of our commons by industry, leading to the collapse of the Global Commons we
                    witness today.
                    The increase of Carbon Dioxide into the commons, the mining of Oxygen from the commons and the
                    pollution of the potable groundwater of the commons has resulted in the degradation of all these
                    elements of the Global Commons.
                    The current economic order based on the combustion of fossil fuels have enjoyed a ‘free rider’
                    that allows the internalizing of costs involved in the use of the Global Commons. The
                    consequences of such subsidies are: Climate Change driven by Carbon Dioxide, reduction of
                    atmospheric concentration of Oxygen, the loss of access to safe drinking water and the loss of
                    both biomass and biodiversity.
                    While the answer to this global crisis rests on the ability of the economic system to tax or
                    charge for the erosion of these aspects of the Global Commons, the political climate today
                    demonstrates an inability or disinterest in addressing these issues and humanity is forced to
                    watch or participate in its destruction masquerading as ‘development’ activity.
                    The threat to climate stability brought about by the burning of fossil fuels have already begun
                    to impact vulnerable communities. Droughts, floods, heatwaves and cyclonic activity is being
                    experienced with increased frequency.

                    The Carbon in Carbon Dioxide released by burning ‘’fossil fuels’ is over 100 million years old
                    and cannot be ‘neutralized’ unless it is placed in a deposit that holds it for 100 million
                    years. Planting a tree to neutralize the effect of burning fossil is a cheat, as the tree will
                    die in a few hundred years and release the Carbon back into the atmosphere.
                    The other issue in using fossil fuels is that it burns the finite Oxygen content of the
                    atmosphere. The need to address the problem becomes more urgent when the massive burning of
                    Oxygen by the defense industry and the aerospace industry is considered. None of these
                    industries demonstrate any responsibility for burning up the global stocks, in fact developers
                    like Elon Musk has openly stated that his operations are profitable because ‘Oxygen is free’. It
                    is this ‘free rider’ that allows the internalizing of costs involved in the use of the Global
                    Commons. A ‘free rider’ that has led to an acceleration of the destruction of the stock of
                    Oxygen in the Global Commons. Paying for its replacement is logical, practical and responsible.
                    As water is a universal solvent, it easily picks up contaminants, especially those produced by
                    human activity, leading to the loss of access to safe drinking water. World Health Organization
                    (WHO) estimates that over 2.2 billion people around the world do not have safely managed
                    drinking water services, this number increases daily. The clean freshwater stocks of the Global
                    Commons have become dangerously compromised, as the quantum of industrial chemicals begin to
                    concentrate in groundwater.
                    The basic problem is the ease with which operators can internalize the stock held in the Global
                    Commons and not be held responsible for such action.

                    In fact, much of the current value realized by the existing economic system, is achieved by
                    internalizing (ie. not paying for) the elements of the Global Commons that they use. Even the
                    new forms
                    of wealth expressed as digital currency still need the internalization of value from the Global
                    Commons
                    to operate.
                    The suggestion extended by these considerations is that ‘the operation of the current economic
                    system
                    leads to the degradation of the Global Commons’ and consequently to the degradation of human
                    wellbeing.
                    Much of the current ‘environmental’ activity being merely an exercise in rearranging the deck
                    chairs on
                    the Titanic’. As pointed out by the UN in 2021, the situation today has become a ‘Code Red’ for
                    humanity, but to expect a solution from the very economy that created the problem, does not
                    provide much
                    hope for the world. Is there anything different that we can do? One suggestion to emerge is to
                    place
                    value on things that externalize their input into the Global Commons, to place value on giving
                    into the
                    global commons to compensate for what we are taking out of it. This is a process of ‘giving
                    back’ or
                    externalizing the output of capable industries which are in turn, valued and recorded. Each unit
                    of
                    Biocurrency value is based on the production of contracted Primary Ecosystem Services (PES)
                    which are
                    the products created by photosynthesis, Oxygen, Carbohydrate and clean water. Recorded over
                    time, these
                    products protect the health and sustainability of a myriad of natural ecosystems on terrestrial
                    landscapes.

                The transaction history maintained as a blockchain, will create a platform for the institution of
                Biocurrency as an exchange system, seeking to create wealth by externalizing transaction values to the
                Global Commons.
                The creation of wealth, reflected as Biocurrency, has the capacity to reverse the destructive path we
                are on. It can redirect the current economic dialogue based on the profit of internalization which is
                leading us to death and destruction, to an economic dialogue based on the profit of externalization,
                leading to life and restoration. One company has already picked up the baton <a
