                    ri Lanka’s country statement to the 21st Conference of the Parties (known as COP21) to the 1992
                    United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Paris in 2015 stated, “We are aware
                    that the critical Ecosystem services such as production of Oxygen, sequestering of Carbon, water
                    cycling and ambient cooling is carried out by the photosynthetic component of biomass. This is being
                    lost at an exponential rate, due to the fact that these Ecosystem Services have not been valued, nor
                    economically recognized. We would request the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to
                    examine the value of photosynthetic biomass.”
                    The most critical and valuable material in maintaining the life support system of the planet is its
                    photosynthetic biomass.
                    Yet this material has been conspicuously under-appreciated and unvalued to date. The growth of the
                    current carbon market in addressing climate change provides real benchmarks and suggests astounding
                    market opportunities. The <a href="http://www.analogforestry.org/">Analog</a> Forestry system of
                    farm based environmental restoration emerges as a promising technology to help capitalize
                    photosynthetic biomass. Photosynthetic biomass performs the act of primary production, the initial
                    step in the manifestation of life.
                </p>
                <p>The biomass so termed has the ability to increase in mass through the absorption of solar or other
                    electromagnetic radiation while releasing oxygen and water vapor into the atmosphere. Respiring
                    biomass is that component of living biomass that uses the output of primary production to make the
                    complicated biological patterns of life; it consumes oxygen to power its functions and does not have
                    photosynthetic functions itself. This distinction would seem to be fundamentally important when
                    assessing the value of biomass that is being addressed. The consideration of biomass contributes to
                    terrestrial primary production as a distinct biomass pool is urgent. As outlined above, it is only
                    photosynthetic biomass that powers carbon sequestration, carbohydrate production, oxygen generation
                    and water transformation, i.e. all actions essential for the sustainability of the life support
                    system of the planet. The photosynthetic biomass in terrestrial ecosystems is largely composed of
                    the leaves of vegetation. While the photosynthetic component of marine ecosystems are comprised
                    mostly of marine algae and phytoplankton. In terrestrial systems, it is the leafy component that
                    contributes to primary production.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description-container text-justify">
                <img id="img-10" src="../../assets/img/community/blog/new blogs/HIRES IMAGES01.png" alt="image of industrial fumes 2" class="img-fluid floating-image left">
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The sheer power of operation of the terrestrial photosynthetic system is seen when the volume of water
                released from photosynthetic biomass is considered, at a water release rate of 100:1, where over 100
                molecules of water are released for each molecule of carbon dioxide absorbed by the leaf. The quantity
                of water released annually by forests and grasslands are like aerial rivers cycling about 6,250 billion
                tons of water into the atmosphere per annum. This quantity of evaporative water not only greatly
                influences local cooling events, but also contributes to the distribution of heat in the atmosphere. One
                ofe most significant consequences of transpiration by terrestrial vegetation is the “cleaning” effect on
                groundwater, releasing round water freed of the chemical pollutants that it was once burdened with. This
                cleaning function is hardly recognized nor evaluated. The oxygen generation function too is taken for
                granted but in the 20th century humanity has pumped increasing amounts of fossil carbon dioxide into the
                atmosphere by burning the carbon stored in coal, petroleum and natural gas. In the process, we’ve also
                been consuming oxygen and destroying plant life, cutting down forests at an alarming rate and thereby
                short circuiting the cycle’s natural rebound. We’re artificially slowing down one process and speeding
                up another, forcing a change in the atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It eems imperative that a real value be placed on photosynthetic biomass; initial computations can begin
                    by considering the current values suggested for the global market for similar functions. The estimated
                    value of the carbon market was in excess of $125 billion in 2008. Thus even if we consider as current,
                    the value of $125 billion that has been placed on containing limate change, the value of photosynthetic
                    biomass can now be addressed. Assuming that the market would pay at least the value of controlling
                    climate change to provide oxygen and clean water, the 93.1 billion tons of photosynthetic carbon
                    currently in stock would be roughly worth about $1.35 per kilogram. This photosynthetic biomass, often
                    considered to be too temporal in accounting for carbon sequestering, is actually the most valuable
                    component.
                    Slowing down the loss of global terrestrial photosynthetic biomass stock is not an option – it is a
                    critical need. A massive investment must go towards incrementing the global photosynthetic biomass
                    stock. The potential value of this stock can also attract the investment to develop market growth. A
                    discussion of the models of high utility and high photosynthetic productivity is urgent. The recognition
                    and evaluation of photosynthetic biomass must become a primary driver of the restoration processes
                    discussed above. It can energize the restoration of biodiversity and the restoration of environmental
                    services.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="description-container text-justify">
                <p>
                    For management purposes, the photosynthetic biomass of a natural ecosystem has to be seen as a continuum
                    of native species from the early seral stages represented by annuals and short lived species, to shrubs
                    and bushes, to pioneer trees, to the mature tree dominated, old growth forest. In restoration
                    methodologies like Analog Forestry where each stage is encouraged to carry its full complement of
                    photosynthetic biomass, the management plans address the generation and maintenance of the optimal
                    levels of photosynthetic biomass in each seral stage and gain the corresponding value.
                    It is a fact that the sustainability of oxygen production is being endangered by the fossil fuel driven
                    economy. The expansion of fossil-based industry and farming at the expense of vast regions of forests
                    and seas not only destabilizes the atmosphere by accelerating global warming and thereby affecting the
                    performance of chlorophyll, but also removes the very basis of life by burning the biologically created
                    oxygen without paying for its replacement.
                </p>
                <p> The signs are all around. A recent study on the levels of oxygen in the ocean found that the oceanic
                    oxygen levels decreased by 2% over the last 50 years. On land, the font of oxygen are the leaves of
                    trees. Another study published in the journal Nature suggests that 15 billion trees are cut down each
                    year and the global tree count has fallen by 46% since the beginning of human civilization. Considering
                    that a tree produces 120 kg of oxygen each year this represents a massive loss. But can we change the
                    current relationship? Can we recognize the value of Primary Ecosystem Services (PES) provided by these
                    trees and assign a value to it?</p>
                    <p>
                        After many years of research, a Sri Lankan company, <a href="http://www.earthrestoration.earth/">Earthrestoration</a>, has developed a system to invest
                        in a facilitate the growth of the market in PES. It is such activity, like restoring our ecosystems and
                        using it to adapt to climate change, that will change the destructive road we have been placed on in the
                        name of “development” and place us on a better path to adapt to the oncoming climate crisis.
                        Climate change is real, the reason for it is “development” based on fossil energy. We have been fooled
                        into believing that greed is development and now we and our children will have to pay the price of this
                        folly, but pointing fingers at the authors of this crisis will not help. We have to take responsibility
                        for what we take out of our Global Commons and make sure we replace what we use.
